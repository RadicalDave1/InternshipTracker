# InternshipTracker
This is a personal side project to help me learn React JS, and the flow of data and CRUD application. I will be making a web application that will track my internship process.

Requirements: 
- Add New Applications
 (Form with inputs: company name, role, location, date applied, status, notes.)

- Edit/Delete Applications

- Track Status
(Dropdown: Applied / Interview / Offer / Rejected.)

- Search bar or filter by status/company.
